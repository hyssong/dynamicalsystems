A dynamical systems model (known as MINDy, developed by [Singh et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117046) and [Chen et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1162/imag_a_00442)) that fits large-scale neural activity time series to estimate model parameters. Model parameters are used to find attractors and fluctuations in attractor landscape over time. Fluctuations in attractor landscape are related with dynamic measures of attentional states, collected by [Song et al., 2023](https://elifesciences.org/articles/85487).
